    "The function creates a list of distances from each data point to a centroid for k centroids and converts this to a matrix. It then finds the lowest distance for each centroid, and assigns the data point for the corresponding distance to a cluster to make k clusters. The new centroids are then obtained by finding the mean of each cluster. The loss is also calculated for all clusters. This cycle is repeated until the loss in one cycle is the same as the previous cycle, indicating no change in centroids.\n",

    "1. **How is probability interpreted differently in the frequentist and Bayesian views?**  \n",
    "You the frequentist view, the probability of an event is essentially the frequency of that event occuring after many trials. The Bayesian view of probability is a measure of the belief of that event occurring.\n",

    "3. **What is the difference between a Bayesian credible interval and a frequentist confidence interval?**  \n",
    "A 95% frequentist confidence interval means the confidence interval will contain the true value 95 out of 100 times. The Bayesian credible interval indicates that the data will be in the interval 95% of the time\n",
